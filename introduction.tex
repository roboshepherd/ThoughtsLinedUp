\section{Issues in multi-robot task allocation}
\label{intro:mrta}
Researchers in the field of robotics generally agree that multiple robots can perform complex and distributed tasks more conveniently. Multi-robot systems can provide improved performance, fault-tolerance and robustness in those tasks through parallelism and redundancy \cite{Arkin1998,Parker+2006}. In last two decades, multi-robot system has been considered for many challenging applications. For example, multi-robot systems can be used in: large space monitoring tasks, e.g underwater environment monitoring \cite{Eriksen+2001}, dangerous tasks e.g., robotic de-mining \cite{Dunbar+2002}, tasks that scale-up or scale-down over time, e.g. factory automation \cite{Wurman+2008}, and so forth.

In order to get potential benefits of multi-robot systems,  one needs to answer a common research question. \textit{How can the tasks be allocated among multiple robots dynamically?} In robotics, this is called \acfi{MRTA} \cite{Gerkey+2004}. This issue can be treated as the \acfi{DOL} among robots, analogous to the DOL in biological and human social systems \cite{Sendova-Franks+1999}. Although the term ``division of labour'' is often used in biological literature and the term ``task-allocation'' is primarily used in multi-agent literature, both of these terms carry similar kinds of meanings with slightly different semantics. Here, these terms have been used interchangeably.

MRTA is generally identified as the question of assigning tasks in an appropriate time to the appropriate robots considering the changes of the environment and/or the performance of other team members \cite{Gerkey+2003}. This is a {\em NP-hard} optimal assignment problem where optimum solutions cannot be found quickly for large and complex problems \cite{Parker2008}. Here NP-hard, abbreviated from non-deterministic polynomial-time hard,  is a class of problems that are ``at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP" \cite{garey1979computers}.

The complexities of the distributed MRTA problem arise from the fact that there is no central planner or coordinator for task assignments, and in large multi-robot systems, generally robots have limited capabilities to sense, to communicate and to interact locally. None of them has complete knowledge of the past, present or future actions of other robots. Moreover, they do not have the complete view of the world state. The computational and communication bandwidth requirements also restrict the solution quality of the problem \cite{Gerkey+2004}.

Researchers from multi-robot and multi-agent systems, operations research and other disciplines have approached the task-allocation issue in many different ways. Traditionally, task allocation in  multi-agent systems have been divided into two major categories: i) predefined and ii) bio-inspired self-organized task-allocation \cite{Shen+2001}.

Early research on predefined task-allocation was dominated by intentional cooperation \cite{Parker2008}, use of dynamic role assignment \cite{Chaimowicz2002} and market-based bidding approach \cite{Dias+2006}. Under these approaches, robots use direct task-allocation method, often to communicate with group members for negotiating on tasks. These approaches are intuitive, comparatively straight forward to design and implement, and can be analysed formally. However, these approaches typically work well only when the number of robots are small ($\leq 10$) \cite{Lerman+2006}.

On the other hand, self-organized task-allocation approach relies on the emergent group behaviours, such as emergent cooperation \cite{Kube+1993}, adaptation rules \cite{Liu+2007}. They are more robust and scalable to large team sizes. However, most of the robotic researchers found that self-organized task-allocation approach is difficult to design, to analyse formally and to implement in real robots. The solutions from these systems are also sub-optimal. It is also difficult to predict exact behaviours of robots and overall system performance.

Within the context of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) project, ``Defying the Rules: How Self-regulatory Systems Work'', the above mentioned self-regulated DOL problem has been tackled in an alternate way \cite{Arcaute+2008}. This approach has been inspired from the studies of emergence of task-allocation in both biological and human social systems. These studies show that a large number of species grow, evolve and generally continue functioning well by the virtue of their individual self-regulatory DOL systems.

The amazing abilities of biological organisms to change, to respond to unpredictable environments, and to adapt over time lead them to sustain life through biological functions such as self-recognition, self-recovery, self-growth etc. It is interesting to note that in animal societies task-allocation has been accomplished year after year without a central authority or an explicit planning and coordinating element. Direct and indirect communication strategies are used to exchange information among individuals \cite{Camazine+2001}.

The decentralized self-growth of Internet and its bottom-up interactions of millions of users around the globe present similar evidence of task-allocation in human social systems \cite{Andriani+2004}. These interactions of individuals happen in the absence of, or in parallel with, strict hierarchy. Moreover from the study of sociology \cite{Sayer+1992}, cybernetics \cite{Beer1981}, strategic management \cite{Kogut2000} and related other disciplines it is found that decentralized self-regulated systems exist in nature and in man-made systems which can grow and achieve self-regulated DOL over time by the virtue of their common bottom-up rules of self-regulation.
 
From the above mentioned multi-disciplinary studies of various complex systems, four generic rules have been proposed in order to explain self-regulation in social systems. These four rules are: \textit{continuous flow of information}, \textit{concurrency}, \textit{learning} and \textit{forgetting}, all of them will be explained in Chapter \ref{afm}. Primarily these rules deal with the issue of deriving local control laws for regulating an individual's task-allocation behaviour that can facilitate the DOL in the entire group. In order to employ these rules in the individual level, a formal model of self-regulated DOL has been developed. AFM provides an abstract framework for self-regulatory DOL in social systems. However, without a proper validation in a real robotic system, it is not possible to claim its applicability to the above MRTA problem. Particularly, the following two questions have been raised.
%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can the AFM be adopted to solve the above MRTA problem for a relatively large group of real robots?
\item Can the AFM be made relevant for industrial scenarios as well as for the emulation of biological tasks?
\end{enumerate}
%%
The first question demands to evaluate the very basic capabilities of AFM, i.e. whether it can provide the basic form of DOL in large groups. As it is well known that conducting real robotic experiments with large number of robots is time consuming and resource intensive, in this study the term ``large group of robots'' is used to mean a group with at least 10 or more robots\footnote{Although this is very difficult to specify a certain number for defining ``large'', a consensus has been found with some other researchers, \protect\citeaffixed{Lerman+2006}{e.g.} that a large group of robots currently stands for roughly 10 or more robots.}. It have been hypothesized that AFM can be used as a distributed task-allocation mechanism for a large group of robots. It should be capable of providing all the basic task-allocation facilities, e.g. plasticity in task-allocation, task-specialization, as discussed in detail in Sec. \ref{bg:def:dol}.

The second question puts AFM under a big challenge. Traditionally, researchers in the area of robotics, who use self-organized task-allocation methods, limit their experiments to test if their models can sufficiently imitate biological tasks, e.g., foraging \cite{Krieger+2000} or prey-retrieval \cite{Labella2007}. These experiments simply match the biological DOL models with their robotic counterparts. However, it has been hypothesized that AFM can work under real task settings where multiple tasks should be served by multiple-robots concurrently. It has been assumed that even if the robots do not perform specific complex industrial tasks with sophisticated hardware modules, AFM can still be used to find the high-level task-allocation performance by mimicking any suitable industrial task. This high-level task-allocation performance can be used as an indication of the validity of AFM for putting it in real-world applications.

The outcome of this research can be applied to solve generic task-allocation problem in numerous multi-agent systems. Generally AFM can be used as a generic framework for DOL in various social systems and particularly,  the outcome of this research can be relevant to design appropriate MRTA solution of large multi-robot systems in order to perform real industrial tasks. For example, this technique can potentially contribute to make multi-robot systems more useful for automated material handling tasks in warehouses or in manufacturing industries. Since last decade these industries have been facing all the existing challenges of traditional centralized and sequential manufacturing processes e.g. changing the manufacturing plant layouts on-the-fly, adapting for high variation in product styles/quantities, and dynamic allocation of active manufacturing resources e.g., robots and \acfp{AGV} \cite{Shen+2006}.

\section{Communication and sensing strategies for task allocation}
\label{intro:comm}
In biological social systems, communications among the group members, as well as sensing the task-in-progress, are two key components of self-organized DOL. In robotics, existing self-organized task-allocation methods rely heavily upon local sensing and local communication of individuals for achieving self-organized task-allocation. However, AFM differs significantly in this point by avoiding the strong dependence on the local communication and interaction found in many existing approaches to MRTA. AFM requires a system-wide continuous flow of information about tasks, agent states etc. But this can be achieved by using both centralized and decentralized communication modes under explicit and implicit communication strategies. Chapter \ref{bg} reviews these communication modes and strategies with necessary details.

In order to enable continuous flow of information in a multi-robot system, two types of sensing and communication strategies have been implemented inspired by the self-regulated DOL found in two types of social wasps: {\em polistes} and {\em polybia} \cite{Jeanne1999}. Depending on the group size, these species follow different strategies for communication and sensing of tasks. Polistes wasps are called the {\em independent founders} in which reproductive females establish colonies alone or in small groups (in the order of $10^2$), but independent of any sterile workers. On the other hand, polybia wasps are called the {\em swarm founders} where a swarm of workers and queens initiate colonies consisting of several hundreds to millions of individuals.

The most notable difference in the organization of work of these two social wasps is: independent founders do not rely on any cooperative task performance while swarm founders interact with each-other locally to accomplish their tasks. The work mode of independent founders can be considered as {\em global sensing - no communication (GSNC)} where the individuals sense the task requirements throughout a small colony and do these tasks without communicating with each other. On the other hand, the work mode of swarm founders can be treated as {\em local sensing - local communication (LSLC)} where the individuals can only sense tasks locally due to large colony-size and they can communicate locally to exchange information, e.g. task-requirements (although their exact mechanism is unknown).

In this study, these two sensing and communication strategies have been used to compare the performance of the self-regulated DOL of a large group of robots under AFM. %Chapter \ref{afm} uses GSNC strategy for enabling system-wide continuous flow of information through a centralized communication mode. Chapter \ref{afm} realizes LSLC strategy among robot controllers by emulating decentralized communication mode with suitable inter-process communication schemes.
The research questions behind putting these strategies into action are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it the case that task-allocation through GSNC strategy should be limited only to small group of robots, like polistes wasps?
\item 
Does the task-allocation performance in large groups significantly vary under GSNC and LSLC strategies?
\end{enumerate}
%%
Regarding the first question, if the self-regulated DOL in a large group of robots is not achieved by following GSNC strategy, it should be concluded that this strategy is inappropriate for a large group. The second question quantitatively investigates the variations of performance due to the use of different communication and sensing strategies. The findings from this comparative study of different bio-inspired communication and sensing strategies can be very useful for designing efficient MRTA solutions. Based on these findings assertions can be made, both quantitatively and qualitatively, whether local communication and local interaction should be considered as the prerequisites to achieve self-regulated DOL in large groups of robots.

\section{Summary of individual contributions}
The main individual contributions made by the author of this thesis, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interpretation of AFM, an inter-disciplinary generic model of DOL, as a basic mechanism of self-regulated MRTA.} Although AFM has been developed as a part of a collaborative EPSRC research project, the author of this thesis has interpreted it for multi-robot systems with an example illustration under a manufacturing shop-floor scenario. This concrete interpretation is original and separate from the  abstract descriptions of AFM provided by the EPSRC project members.
\item \textbf{Validation of the model through experiments with reasonably large number of real robots i.e., 16 e-puck robots.} Although  AFM was constructed under the EPSRC project collaboration, no solid methodology was given to validate it. Hence the author has proposed and formalized the necessary observables and parameters to validate AFM. 
\item \textbf{Comparisons of the performances of two bio-inspired sensing and communication strategies in achieving self-regulated MRTA.} This is solely contributed by the author since AFM does not provide any framework for realizing communication among the individuals of a social group.
\item Development of a flexible multi-robot control architecture using D-Bus inter-process communication technology. This is an original contribution of the author towards developing a flexible multi-robot control framework.
\item Classification of MRTA solutions based on three major axes: organization of task-allocation, interaction and communication. The  author has conceived this taxonomy and has provided necessary explanations. 
\end{itemize}
