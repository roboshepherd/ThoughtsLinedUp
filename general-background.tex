\subsection{Self-regulation}
\label{bg:def:self-reg}
Animals and flying beings, that live on or above earth, form social communities similar to human societies \cite{SIHQ1995}. In recent years, the study of biological social insects and other animals reveals to us that simple individuals of these self-organized  societies can solve various complex and large everyday-problems with a few behavioural rules, relying on their minimum sensing and communication abilities \cite{Camazine+2001}. Some common tasks of these biological societies include: dynamic foraging, building amazing nest structures, maintaining division of labour among workers \cite{Bonabeau+1999}. These tasks are done by colonies  ranging from a few animals to thousands or millions of individuals. Despite their huge colony size, they easily achieve surprising efficiency in those tasks with many common features, e.g. robustness, flexibility, synergy (for an example in ants, see Fig. \ref{fig:self-org-ants}).

Today, these findings have inspired scientists and engineers to use this knowledge of biological self-organization in developing solutions for various problems of artificial systems, such as  routing traffic in telecommunication and vehicle networks, designing control algorithms for large groups of autonomous robots, automating industrial shop-floor tasks and so forth \cite{Garnier+2007}.

Self-organization, in biological and  other systems, is often characterized in terms of four major ingredients: 1) positive feedback, 2) negative feedback, 3) presence of multiple interactions among individuals and their environment, and 4) amplification of fluctuations  e.g., random walks, errors, random task-switching \cite{Camazine+2001}. An external observer, as if looking through transparent glasses, can recognize a self-organized system by observing the individual interactions of that system from four interlinked perspectives (Fig. \ref{fig:self-org-1}). 

The first perspective is the {\em  positive feedback} or amplification that can be resulted from the execution of simple behavioural ``rules of thumb''. For example, recruitment to a food source through trail laying and trail following in some ants  is due to the positive feedback that attract other ants to follow the trail and to lay more pheromones over time. The second perspective is the {\em negative feedback} that counterbalances positive feedback. This usually occurs to stabilize collective patterns, e.g., crowding at the food sources (saturation), competition between paths to food sources etc. The third perspective is the {\em presence of multiple  interactions} that can be direct \acf{P2P}, broadcast or indirect {\em stigmergic}, e.g. ants' pheromone laying. Finally, the fourth  perspective is the {\em amplification of fluctuations} that comes from various stochastic events. For example, errors in trail following of some ants may lead some foragers to get lost and later on, to find new and unexploited food sources, and recruit other ants to those sources.

In a self-organized system, an individual agent may have limited cognitive, sensing and communication capabilities. But they are collectively capable of solving complex and large problems, e.g. coordinated nest construction of honey-bees (Fig. \ref{fig:honey-bee-nest}), collective defence of school of fishes from a predator attack (Fig. \ref{fig:school-of-fish}), ordered homing of bats (Fig. \ref{fig:bats-colony}).  Since the discovery of these collective behavioural patterns of self-organized societies, scientists observed modulation or adaptation of behaviours in the individual level \cite{Garnier+2007}. For example, in order to prevent a life-threatening humidity-drop in the colony, cockroaches maintain a locally sustainable humidity level by increasing their tendency to aggregate, i.e. by regulating their individual aggregation behaviours.

%%
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:self-org-agent}, the  self-regulation of an individual agent is depicted through a triangle where its base-arm represents the simple behavioural rules of thumb (in this case, intense aggregation of cockroaches in low humidity). This is supported by two side-arms: local communication and local sensing. This local sensing is sometimes also referred to as sensing or information gathering from the work in progress, e.g. stigmergy and this local communication is an instance of direct communication with neighbours  \cite{Camazine+2001}.

Self-regulation has been studied in many other branches of knowledge. In most places of literature, self-regulation refers to the exercise of control over oneself to bring the self into line with preferred standards \cite{Baumeister+2007}. One of the most notable self-regulatory process is the human body's homoeostatic process where the human body's inner process seeks to return to its regular temperature when it gets overheated or chilled. \citeasnoun{Baumeister+2007} has referred self-regulation to goal-directed behaviour or feedback loops, whereas self-control may be associated with conscious impulse control.

In psychology, self-regulation denotes the strenuous actions to resist temptation or to overcome anxiety. In this domain, self-regulation is broadly divided into two categories: i) conscious and ii) unconscious self-regulation. Conscious self-regulation puts emphasis on conscious and deliberate efforts in self-regulation. On the other hand, unconscious self-regulation refers to the automatic self-regulatory process that is not labour intensive but operate in harmony with unpredictable and unfolding events in the environment. This process uses the available informational input in ways that help to attain an activated goal.

The concept of self-regulation is also common in cybernetic theory where self-regulation in inanimate mechanisms shows that they can regulate themselves by making adjustments according to pre-programmed goals or set standards. A common example of this kind can be found in a thermostat that controls a heating and cooling system to maintain a desired temperature in a room. In physics, chemistry, biology and some other branches of natural sciences, the concept of self-regulation is centred around the study of self-organizing individuals. 

Self-regulation has also been studied in the context of human social systems. Here it is originated from the division of social labour that creates self-organized processes with self-regulating effects \cite{Kppers+1990}. Two types of self-regulation have been reported in many places of sociology literature: i) self-regulation from self-organization and ii) self-regulation from activities of components in a heterarchical organization. It is interesting to note that self-regulation in biological species provides  similar evidence of bottom-up approach to self-regulation of heterarchical organization through the interaction of individuals in the absence, or in parallel, of strict hierarchy \cite{Beer1981}.

From the above discussion, it is clear that the term {\em self-regulation} carries a wide range of meanings in different branches of knowledge. In psychology and cognitive neuroscience, self-regulation is discussed solely within an individual's perspective whereas, in biology and social sciences, self-regulation is discussed within the context of a group of individuals or society as a whole. In  this thesis, the latter context is more appropriate where  self-regulation focuses on monitoring an individual's own state and environmental changes, in relation to the communal goal and, in turn, this leads to adjust the behaviours of that individual with respect to the changes found.

\subsection{Communication} 
\label{bg:def:comm}
\textbf{What is Communication?} Defining {\em communication} can be challenging due to the use of this term in several disciplines with somewhat different meanings. This has been portrayed in the writing of Sarah Trenholm \cite{West+2003} who describes communication as a piece of luggage overstuffed with all manners of odd ideas and meanings. \citeasnoun{West+2003} defines communication  as:
\begin{quote}
\ssp
``A social process where individuals employ symbols to establish and interpret meaning in their environment.''
\end{quote}
\sdp
 The notion of being a ``social process'' involves, at least two or more individuals engaged in dynamic and ongoing interactions. Moreover, symbols can be simply some sort of arbitrary labels given to a phenomena and they can represent  concrete objects or  abstract ideas.
% Encyclopaedia Britannica also defines communication as ``the exchange of meanings between individuals through a common system of symbol''. But since this definition lacks the notion of sociality we find this definition incomplete.In our view, communication process takes place within the context of  symbol or message exchange between two or more parties with a clear intent to influence each others' behaviours.

\caption{ A biological model of communication, adopted from \protect\citeasnoun{Frings1997}.}
\label{fig:bio-comm-defined} 
\end{figure}
%
According to a biological model of communication (Fig. \ref{fig:bio-comm-defined}), communication is a biological process where an  individual (sender) intentionally transmits encoded message though a physical signal and that, on being received and decoded by another individual of same species (receiver), influences receiver's behaviour \cite{Frings1997}. Note that, here individuals are of same species and thus they have a  shared message vocabulary and mechanism of message encoding/decoding. Although  this definition has not included the dynamics of a communication process, it is more precise for low-level biological and artificial systems. It accounts for the behavioural changes during communication process. These changes can be tracked through observing states of individuals.

%%
\textbf{Models of Communication.} The elements of communication can be analysed to find the whole picture involved in an individual's communication and sensing process. This can be explained through the study of the models  of communication. There exists plenty of models of communication. Here three prominent models: i) linear model, ii) interaction model and iii) transaction model, have been discussed briefly.

%%FIG:  Comm defined

\end{figure}
%
Fig. \ref{fig:gen-comm-defined} embeds first two models inside a single circle. The linear model is shown by dashed lines. This model was introduced by Claude Shanon and Warren Weaver in 1949. Here communication is a one way process where a {\em message} is sent from a {\em source} to a {\em receiver} through a {\em channel}.

In Fig. \ref{fig:gen-comm-defined}, around the linear model, interaction model has been drawn. This model, proposed by Wilber Schramm in 1954, views communication as a two-way process that uses an additional {\em feedback} element  linking both source and receiver. This feedback is a response given to the source by the receiver to confirm how the message is being understood. Here, during message passing, both source and receiver utilize their individual {\em field of experiences} that describe the overlap of their common experiences, cultures etc. 

Unlike separate field of experiences and discrete sending and receiving of messages, in the transactional model, introduced by Barnlund in 1970, the sending and receiving of messages are done simultaneously. Here, the  field of experiences of source and receiver can overlap to some degree. In all of the above three models, {\em noise} or a common message distorting element is present in the communication process. This noise can occur from the linguistic influences, i.e. message semantics,  physical or bodily influences, cognitive influences or even from biological
or physiological influences e.g., anger or shouting voice while talking.

The above models of communication describe the incremental complexities of message exchanging in the communication process. Surely, the transactional model is the most elegant model that prescribes adjusting the sender's message content while receiving an implicit or explicit feedback in real-time. For example, while advising her son to read a story book, a mother may alter her verbal message as she simultaneously ``reads'' the non-verbal message from her child's face. 

However, in case of a multi-robot system, such sophistication in communication may not be required or realizable by the current state-of-the-art in multi-robot communication technology. In this study, a simple linear model has been adopted. This meets the necessary communication requirements of a multi-robot system. The feedback has not been considered as it is assumed that all robots of an artificial multi-robot system have a common shared vocabulary such that a message is understood as it is sent.

%%
\textbf{Communication modes and strategies.} The communication  structure of a system can broadly be classified into two major categories: centralized communication and decentralized or local communication. A centralized communication system generally has a central entity, e.g. a gateway,  that routes all incoming and outgoing communications. Individual nodes of this system often do not communicate with each other directly. But they can send and receive messages through this central gateway.  This central entity can play other roles, such as access control, resource allocation and so on. On the other hand, in local communication, there is no central entity and each node can independently route messages to others.

In both biological and robotic literature two basic types of communication are often discussed: 1) direct or explicit communication and 2) indirect or implicit communication. {\em Direct communication} is an intentional communicative act of message passing that aims at one or more particular receiver(s) \cite{Mataric1998}. It typically exchanges information through physical signals. 

In contrast, {\em indirect communication}, sometimes termed as {\em stigmergy} in biological literature, happens as a form of modifying the environment, e.g. pheromone dropping by ants \cite{Bonabeau+1999}. In an ordinary sense, this is an observed behaviour and many robotic researchers call it as {\em no communication} \cite{Labella2007}. In order to avoid ambiguity, in this dissertation, the term {\em communication}, always represents {\em direct} communication.

Direct or explicit communication can be limited by a communication range and thus by a number of target recipients. Under both centralized and local communication, nodes can select a certain number of target recipients of their messages. This process specifies {\em to whom} a node intends to communicate. In this thesis, this mechanism of target recipient(s) selection has been denoted as {\em communication strategy}.

\end{figure} 

Fig. \ref{fig:comm-strategies} shows the most common communication strategies found in a  social system.  In the simplest case, when only two nodes can communicate this becomes P2P communication. When nodes can spread information to a limited number of peers of their locality, the communication takes the form of {\em local broadcast}, i.e. one sender and a few receivers within a certain locality. For example, when a foraging honey-bee gives the information of flower sources to a number of peers through various dances, it conveys this information to a few peers through a local broadcast. However, giving the sample of nectar through tactile or taste to its peers can be considered as an instance of P2P communication. The {\em global broadcast} strategy can be found in almost all social species to handle emergency situations, e.g. emitting alarm signal in danger.

\end{figure}

Encyclopaedia Britannica \citeasnoun{DOL2010} serves the definition of {\em division of labour} as the ``separation of a work process into a number of tasks, where each task is performed by a separate person or a group of persons''. Originated from economics and sociology, the term division of labour is widely used in many branches of knowledge. As mentioned by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, the founder of modern economics:
\begin{quote}
\ssp 
The great increase of the quantity of work, which in consequence of the division of labour the same number of people are capable of performing, is owing to three different circumstances; firstly, to increase the dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another; and lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.
(Adam Smith (1776) in \citeasnoun{Sendova-Franks+1999})
\end{quote} 
\sdp
In sociology, DOL usually denotes the work specialization \cite{Sayer+1992}. Basically, it answers three major questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em What task?} This gives us the description of the tasks to be done, service to be rendered or products to be manufactured.
\item {\em Why dividing it to individuals?} This states the underlying social standards for this division, such as task appropriateness based on class, gender, age, skill etc.
\item {\em How to divide it?} This relates to the method or process of separating the whole task into small pieces of tasks that can be performed easily. 
\end{enumerate}
%%
DOL is commonly observed in social insects, such as in termites (Fig. \ref{fig:termite-nest}(a)), ants, honey-bees and other biological societies. Two major metrics of DOL have been established in literature: i) task specialization and ii) plasticity. {\em Task specialization} is an integral part of DOL where a worker usually does not perform all tasks, but rather specializes in a set of tasks, according to its morphology, age, or chance \cite{Bonabeau+1999}. This DOL among nest-mates, whereby different activities are performed simultaneously by groups of specialized individuals, is believed to be more efficient than if tasks are performed sequentially by unspecialised individuals.

DOL is also characterized by {\em plasticity} which means that the removal of one class of workers is quickly compensated for by other workers. Thus distributions of workers among different concurrent tasks keep changing according to the external (environmental) and internal conditions of a colony \cite{Garnier+2007}.

In artificial social systems, like multi-agent or multi-robot system, the term ``division of labour'' is often found synonymous to ``task-allocation'' \cite{Shen+2001}. However, some researchers  argued to distinguish these terms due to the origin and particular contextual use of these terms \cite{Labella2007}. Particularly, DOL adopts the biological notion of collective task performance with little or no communication. On the other hand, task allocation follows the meaning of assigning task(s) to particular robot(s) based on individual robot capabilities, typically through explicit communication, such as {\em intentional cooperation} \cite{Parker1998}. Generally, the former is considered by \textit{swarm robotic system} and latter is done under {\em traditional multi-robot system}. Sec. \ref{bg:mrs:overview} covers both of these approaches and Sec. \ref{bg:mrta} provides critical reviews on DOL under these approaches.

In this dissertation, in order to define DOL, the biological approach has been adopted that emphasizes on having task-specialization and plasticity among workers. However, no restriction on the use of communication has been imposed. In fact, DOL has been viewed as a group-level phenomenon which occurs due to the individual agent's self-regulatory task-allocation behaviour. AFM, the model of self-regulated DOL used in this thesis, provides us necessary abstractions to the communication and sensing processes of individuals that are discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{afm} and \ref{local-comm}.

\section{Communication in biological social systems}
\label{bg:bio-comm}
Communication plays a central role in self-regulated DOL of biological social systems.In this section, communication among  social insects are briefly reviewed.
%
\subsection{Purposes, modalities and ranges}
Communication in biological societies serves many closely related social purposes. Most P2P communication include: recruitment to a new food source or nest site, exchange of food particles, recognition of individuals, simple attraction, grooming, sexual communication etc. In addition to that colony-level broadcast communication include: alarm signal, territorial and home range signals and nest markers, communication for achieving certain group effect such as facilitating or inhibiting  a group activity \cite{Holldobler1990}.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

%[Modalities and Ranges]
Biological social insects use different modalities to establish social communication, such as sound, vision, chemical, tactile,  electric and so forth (Table \ref{table:bio-comm-modalities}).  Sound waves can travel a long distance and thus they are suitable for advertising signals. They are also best for transmitting complicated information quickly \cite{Slater1986}. Visual signals can travel more rapidly than sound, but they are limited by the physical size or line of sight of an animal. They also do not travel around obstacles. Thus they are suitable for short-distance private signals.

\end{figure}
%
In ants and some other social insects, chemical communication is predominant.  A pheromone is a chemical substance, usually a type of glandular secretion, used for communication within species \cite{Holldobler1990}. One individual releases it as a signal and others respond to it after tasting or smelling. Using pheromones individuals can code quite complicated messages in smells. For example, a typical ant colony operates with somewhere between 10 and 20 kinds of signals. Most of these are chemical in nature. If wind and other conditions are favourable,  this type of signals emitted by such a tiny species can be detected from several kilometres away. Thus chemical signals are extremely economical of their production and transmission. But they are quite slow to diffuse away. But ants and other social insects manage to create sequential and compound messages either by a graded reaction of different concentrations of same substance or by blends of signals. Fig.\ref{fig:fireflies} shows the social communication of fireflies by  synchronous light signals.

Tactile communication is also widely observed in ants and other species typically by using their body antennae and forelegs. It is observed that in ants touch is primarily used  for receiving information rather than informing something. It is usually found as an invitation behaviour in worker recruitment process. When an ant intends to recruit a nest-mate for foraging or other tasks it runs towards a nest-mate and beats its body very lightly with  antennae and forelegs. The recruiter then runs to a recently laid pheromone trail or lays a new one. In this form of communication limited amount of information is exchanged. In underwater environment some fishes and other species also communicate through electric signals where their nerves and muscles work as batteries. They use continuous or intermittent pulses with  different frequencies to learn about environment and to convey their identity and aggression messages.

\end{figure}
The concept of active space (AS) is widely used to describe the propagation of signals by species. In a network environment of signal emitters and receivers, active space is defined as the area encompassed by the signal during the course of transmission \cite{Mcgregor2000}. In case of long-range signals, or even in case of short-range signals, this area include several individuals where their social grouping allows them to stay in cohesion. The concept of active space is described somewhat differently in the case of some social insects. In the case of ants, this active space is defined as a zone within which the concentration of pheromone (or any other behaviourally active chemical substance) is at or above threshold concentration \cite{Holldobler1990}. Mathematically this is denoted by a ratio:
\begin{equation}
AS = \frac{\textit{Amount of pheromone emitted (Q)}}{\textit{Threshold concentration at which the receiving ant responds (K)}}
\end{equation}
Here, Q is measured in number of molecules released in a burst or in per unit of time whereas K is measured in molecules per unit of volume. 
Fig. \ref{fig:ants-active-space} shows the use of active spaces of two species of ants: (a) {\em Atta texana} and (b) {\em Myrmicaria eumenoides}.  The former one uses two different concentrations of {\em 4-methyl-3-heptanone} to create attraction and alarm signals, whereas the latter one uses two different chemicals: {\em Beta-pinene} and {\em Limonene} to create similar kinds of signals, i.e. alerting and circling.
 
The adjustment of this ratio enables individuals to gain a shorter fade-out time and permits signals to be more sharply pinpointed in time and space by the receivers. In order to transmit the location of the animal in the signal, the rate of information transfer can be increased by either lowering the rate of emission of Q or by increasing K, or both. For alarm and trail systems a lower value of this ratio is used. Thus, according to need, individuals regulate their active space by making it large or small, or by reaching their maximum radius quickly or slowly, or by enduring briefly or for a long period of time. For example, in case of alarm, recruitment and sexual communication signals where encoding the location of an individual is needed, the information in each signal increases as the logarithm of the square of distance over which the signal travels. From the precise study of pheromones it has been found that active space of alarm signal consists of a concentric pair of hemispheres (Fig. \ref{fig:ants-active-space}). As an ant enters the outer zone, she is attracted inward toward the point source; when she next crosses into the central hemisphere she becomes alarmed. It is also observed that ants can release pheromones with different active spaces.

Active space has strong role in modulating the behaviours of ants. For example, when workers of {\em Acanthomyops claviger} ants produce alarm signal due to an attack by a rival or insect predator, workers sitting a few millimetres away begin to react within seconds. However, those ants sitting a few centimetres away take a minute or longer to react. In many cases, ants and other social insects exhibit modulatory communication within their active space where many individuals involve in many different tasks. For example, while retrieving the large prey, workers of {\em Aphaeonogerter} ants produce chirping sounds (known as \textit{stridulate}) along with releasing poison gland pheromones. These sounds attract more workers and keep them within the vicinity of the dead prey to protect it from their competitors. This communication amplification behaviour can increase the active space to a maximum distance of 2 meters.

\subsection{Common communication strategies}
\label{bg:bio-comm:strategies}
In biological social systems, many different kinds of communication strategies can be observed. They may include indirect pheromone trail laying to local and global broadcast of various signals. Sec. \ref{bg:def:comm} discusses the most common four communication strategies in natural and artificial world, i.e. indirect, P2P, local and global broadcast communication strategies. Table \ref{table:bio-comm-strategy} lists the use of various communication modalities under different communication strategies. Here a few real examples of those strategies from biological social systems have been given.

In biological literature, the pheromone trail laying is one of the most discussed indirect communication strategy among various species of ants. Fig. \ref{fig:ant-indirect} shows a pheromone trail following of a group of foraging ants. This indirect communication strategy effectively helps ants to find a better food source among multiple sources, find shorter distance to a food source, marking nest site and move there etc. \cite{Hughes2008}. Local broadcast communication with nearby peers  and direct P2P communication strategy is also very common among most of the biological species. For example,  Fig. \ref{fig:honey-bee-local-bc} shows the local broadcast communication among honey-bees and and Fig. \ref{fig:honey-bee-dances} illustrates this strategy with two distinct types of honey-bee dances.

Similarly, Fig. \ref{fig:bees-ants-p2p-comm} shows the P2P communication of both honey-bees and ants. This tactile form of communication is very effective to exchange food item, flower nectar with each-other or this can be useful even in recruiting nest-mates to a new food source or nest-site.

\subsection{Roles of communication in task-allocation}
\label{bg:bio-comm:comm-role}
Communication among nest-mates and sensing of tasks are the integral parts of the self-regulated DOL process in biological social systems. They create necessary  preconditions for switching from one task to another or to attend dynamic urgent tasks. Suitable communication strategies favour individuals to select better tasks. For example, \citeasnoun{Garnier+2007} reported two worker-recruitment experiments on black garden ants and honey-bees. The scout ants of {\em Lasius niger}  recruit uninformed ants to food source using a well-laid pheromone trails. {\em Apis mellifera} honey-bees also recruit nest-mates to newly discovered distant flower sources through waggle-dances. In the experiments,  poor food sources were given first to both ants and honey-bees. After some time,  rich food sources were introduced  to them. It was found that only honey-bees were able to switch from poor source to a rich source using their sophisticated dance communication.

Table \ref{table:bio-comm-task-urgency} presents the link between sensing the task and self-regulation of communication behaviours among ants and honey-bees. Here, it is seen that communication is modulated based on the perception of  task-urgency irrespective of the communication strategy of a particular species. Under indirect communication strategy of ants, i.e. pheromone trail-laying, it is seen that the principles of self-organization, e.g. positive and negative feedbacks take place due to the presence of different amounts of pheromone for different time periods. Initially, food source located at shorter distance gets relatively more ants  as the ants take less time to return to the nest. So, more pheromone deposits can be found in this path as a result of positive feedback process.  Thus, the density of pheromones or the strength of indirect communication link reinforces ants to follow this particular trail.

Similarly, perception of task-urgency influences the P2P and broadcast communication strategies. {\em Leptothorax albipennis} ant take less time in assessing a relatively better nest site and quickly return home to recruit its nest-mates \cite{Pratt+2002}. Here, the quality of nest directly influences its intent to make more ``tandem-runs'' or to do tactile communication with nest-mates. The influences of the quality of  flower sources to honey-bee dance have already been discussed.  Fig. \ref{fig:honey-bee-dance-stat} shows this phenomena more vividly. It has been plotted using the data from the honey-bee round-dance experiments of \citeasnoun[p. 45]{Von1967}. In this plot, Y1 line refers to the concentration of sugar solution. This solution was kept in a bowl  to attract honey-bees and the amount of this solution was varied from $\frac{3}{16}$M to 2M (taken as 100\%). In this experiment, the variation of this control parameter influenced honey-bees' communication behaviours while producing an excellent self-regulated DOL.

In Fig. \ref{fig:honey-bee-dance-stat} Y2 line represents the number of collector bees that return home. The total number of collectors was 55 (taken as 100\%). Y3 line plots the percent of collectors displaying round dances. It is seen that the fraction of dancing collectors is directly proportional to the concentration of sugar solution or the sensing of task-urgency. Similarly, the average duration of dance per bee  is plotted in Y4 line. The maximum dancing period was 23.8s (taken as 100\%). Finally, from Y5 line it is seen that the outcome of the round-dance communication as the number of newly recruited bees to the feeding place. The maximum number of recruited bees was 18 (taken as 100\%). So, from an overall observation, it can be seen that bees sense the concentration of food-source  as the task-urgency and they self-regulate their round-dance communication behaviour according to their perception of this task-urgency. Thus, this self-regulated dancing behaviour of honey-bees attracts an optimal number of inactive bees to work.

Broadcast communication is one of the classic ways to handle dynamic and urgent tasks in biological social systems. It can be commonly observed in birds, ants, bees and many other species. Table \ref{table:bio-comm-task-urgency} mentions about the alarm communication of ants. Similar to the honey-bee's dance communication, ants have a rich language of chemical communication that can produce words through blending of different glandular secretions in different concentrations. Fig. \ref{fig:ants-active-space} shows how ants can use different concentrations of chemicals to make different stimulus for other ants. From the study of ants, it is clear that taking defensive actions, upon sensing a danger, is one of the highest-priority tasks in an ant colony. Thus, for a highly urgent task, ants almost always use their global broadcast communication strategy through their strong chemical signals and they make sure all individuals can hear about this task.  This gives a coherent picture of the self-regulation of biological species based on their perception of task-urgency.

\subsection{Effect of group size on communication}
\label{bg:bio-comm:group-size}
The performance of cooperative tasks in large group of individuals also depends on the communication and sensing strategies adopted by the group. As introduced in Sec. \ref{intro:comm}, from the study of social wasps,   it is found that depending on the group size, different kinds of information flow occur in different types of social wasps \cite{Jeanne1999}. Polistes independent founders (Fig. \ref {fig:social-wasps}(a)) are species in which reproductive females establish colonies alone or in small groups with about $10^2$ individuals at maturity. Polybia swarm founders (Fig. \ref {fig:social-wasps}(b)) initiate colonies by swarm of workers and queens. They have a large number of individuals, in the order of $10^6$ and 20\% of them can be queen.

\end{figure}
Fig. \ref{fig:wasps-info-flow} compares the occurrence of information flow among independent and swarm founders. In case of swarm founders information about nest-construction or broods food-demand can not reach to foragers directly. Fig. \ref{figs:sf-wasps-info-flow} shows the path of information flow among swarm founders for nest construction. The works of {\em pulp foragers} and {\em water foragers} depend largely on their communication with {\em builders}. On the other hand, in case of independent founders there is no such communication and sensing are present among individuals. In Sec. \ref{intro:comm}  these two types communication and sensing strategies have been termed as GSNC (for independent founders) and LSLC (swarm founders).

\citeasnoun{Jeanne1999} explained the above phenomena of selecting different strategies in terms of task-specialization patterns and stochastic properties found in the group. In case of large colonies, many individuals repeatedly perform same tasks as this minimizes their interferences, although they still have a little probability to select a different task randomly. But because of the large group size, the queuing delay in inter-task switching keeps this task-switching probability very low. Thus, in swarm founders, task-specialization becomes very high among individuals. On the other hand, in small group of independent founders, specialization on a specific task is very costly, because this prevents individuals not to do other tasks whose task-urgencies can soon become very high. Thus these individuals tend to become generalist and do not communicate task information with each other.

%%
The above interesting findings on GSNC and LSLC in social wasps have been linked up with  the group productivity of wasps. Fig. \ref{fig:wasps-group-productivity} illustrates high group productivity in case of LSLC of swarm founders. The per capita productivity was measured as the number of cells built in the nest in (a) and the weight of dry brood in grams in (b). In case of independent founders this productivity is much lesser (max. 24 cells per queen at the time the first offspring observed) comparing to the thousands of cells produced by swarm founders.  This shows  us the direct link between high productivity of social wasps and their selection of LSLC strategy. These fascinating findings from wasp colonies have motivated us to test these communication and sensing strategies in a fairly large multi-robot system to achieve an effective self-regulated MRTA.
