\begin{verse}
``There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings, but they are peoples like unto you. We have neglected nothing in the Book (of Our decrees). Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.'' (Chapter 6, verse:38)
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
``And your Lord inspired the bees, saying:``Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect. Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you)'' There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think.''
(Chapter 6, verses:68-69)
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
`` At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said:``O ye ants get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it''.''
(Chapter 27, verse:18) 
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
``Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding them in? None can uphold them except (Allah) Most Gracious: truly it is He that watches over all things.'' 
(Chapter 67, verse:18)
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
``The likeness of those who choose other patrons than Allah is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all houses is the spider's house, if they but knew.''
(Chapter 29, verse:40)
